Predicting Exercise Quality Using Machine Learning

Overview
This project aims to predict the quality of exercise movements using data from accelerometers placed on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell of six participants. The participants performed barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in five different ways. Using machine learning techniques, this project classifies the movements into different categories based on the provided sensor data.

Dataset
The dataset for this project is obtained from the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset. The training and testing data can be accessed via the following links:
- *Training Data:* [Download](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv)
- *Testing Data:* [Download](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv)

Each row in the dataset represents a single movement instance, and each column represents a recorded sensor measurement. The target variable to predict is classe, which categorizes the movement quality.

Project Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
- Load and clean the dataset
- Remove missing and irrelevant features
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions

2. Feature Engineering
- Identify the most relevant features for classification
- Normalize or scale features if necessary

3. Model Selection
- Train different machine learning models (Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, etc.)
- Compare performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Select the best-performing model

4. Model Evaluation
- Perform cross-validation to estimate out-of-sample error
- Analyze feature importance
- Test the model on an unseen dataset

5. Predictions
- Apply the trained model to predict the movement quality for 20 new test cases

Results
The selected model provides high accuracy in predicting movement quality. The final trained model is tested using cross-validation, and its performance metrics are recorded. The confusion matrix and feature importance plots help interpret the model’s effectiveness.

How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/exercise-quality-prediction.git
   cd exercise-quality-prediction
   
2. Install the necessary R packages:
   r
   install.packages(c("caret", "randomForest", "ggplot2"))
   
3. Open and run the R Markdown (.Rmd) file in RStudio or execute the script step by step.
4. The final predictions for the test dataset will be generated and saved.
